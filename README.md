**Ember-dyna-table** is an [Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/) addon that includes a powerful component for creating frontends with complicated tablesâ€”i.e., involving filtering/sorting/pagination/etc. It aims to balance functionality and extensibility by providing these capabilities/features:

* a custom rendering component for table cells
* dynamic/rearrangeable/toggable columns
* the possibility to send actions from the cell component to upper components
* valid HTML

You can use this addon out of the box. For the most common use cases, Ember-dyna-table requires only minimal development effort. However, it's open to extension for anyone seeking more sophisticated features.

`ember install ember-dyna-table`
